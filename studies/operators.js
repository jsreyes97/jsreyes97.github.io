//1. Assignment Operators 
//Assignment operators assign values to variables.
/*
=	    x = y	    x = y
+=	    x += y	    x = x + y
-=	    x -= y	    x = x - y
*=	    x *= y	    x = x * y
/=	    x /= y	    x = x / y
%=	    x %= y	    x = x % y
**=	x   **= y	    x = x ** y
*/

//2.Arithmatic Operators
//Are used to perform arithmatic on numbers
/* 
+	  Addition
-	   Subtraction
* 	   Multiplication
**	   Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	   Division
%	   Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	   Increment
--	   Decrement
*/

//3.Comparison Operators
//are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
/*
==	   equal to
===	   equal value and equal type
!=	   not equal
!==	   not equal value or not equal type
>	   greater than
<	   less than
>=	   greater than or equal to
<=	   less than or equal to
?	   ternary operator
*/

//4.Logical Operators
// are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
/*
&&	  logical and
||    logical or
!	  logical not
*/

//5.Unary Operators
/*
Unary plus (+)	           Tries to convert the operand into a number
*Unary negation (-) *	   Tries to convert the operand into a number and negates after
Logical Not (!)	           Converts to boolean value then negates it
Increment (++)	           Adds one to its operand
Decrement (--)	           Decrements by one from its operand
Bitwise not (~)	           Inverts all the bits in the operand and returns a number
typeof	                   Returns a string which is the type of the operand
delete	                   Deletes specific index of an array or specific property of an object
void	                   Discards a return value of an expression.
